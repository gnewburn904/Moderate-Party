Our Platform
Common-sense solutions for the challenges facing regular Americans
👮
Public Safety
We believe every community deserves to feel safe. We'll hire 100,000 additional police officers nationwide to strengthen community policing, improve response times, and build trust between law enforcement and the neighborhoods they serve. Safe streets are fundamental to a thriving society.
💰
Taxes & Spending
Fiscal responsibility matters. We'll raise the top marginal tax rate to ensure the wealthiest pay their fair share while working to balance the federal budget. Smart spending and fair taxation will reduce our deficit and invest in America's future without burdening middle-class families.
🛡️
National Security
Peace through strength remains our guiding principle. We support a strong national defense based on Mutually Assured Force Only (MAFO) - maintaining military readiness to deter aggression while avoiding unnecessary conflicts. A powerful America keeps the peace without being the world's police force.
🌍
International Relations
America thrives when the world trades freely and peacefully. We support open trade agreements that benefit American workers and consumers, while maintaining diplomatic relationships with all nations. Cooperation, not isolation, makes us stronger and more prosperous.
🗽
Immigration
America has always been a nation of immigrants. We welcome everyone who comes peacefully and wants to contribute to our society. A fair, efficient immigration system that processes people quickly while maintaining security serves everyone's interests and honors our heritage as a land of opportunity.
🏥
Health Care
Quality healthcare starts with more healthcare workers. We'll invest in training programs to increase the number of doctors and nurses nationwide. We'll also learn from recent challenges to prepare robust pandemic response systems, ensuring we're never caught unprepared again.
📚
Education
Every child deserves a great start and quality education. We support universal Pre-K to give all children equal opportunities from the beginning, and we believe parents should have school choice to find the best fit for their family. Education is the foundation of opportunity.
🌱
Environment
Clean air and clean water aren't political issues - they're human necessities. We'll enforce environmental protections to ensure every American has access to safe drinking water and breathable air, while taking meaningful action to address global warming through practical, science-based policies.
⚡
Energy
Nuclear energy is clean, reliable, and American. We'll invest in next-generation nuclear power plants to achieve energy independence while reducing carbon emissions. Modern nuclear technology is safe and provides the consistent power our economy needs without relying on foreign oil.
🛣️
Infrastructure
America's roads, bridges, and public transit systems need serious attention. We'll invest in repairing and modernizing our infrastructure to improve safety, reduce commute times, and support economic growth. Good infrastructure isn't a luxury - it's essential for a functioning country.
🤝
Social Insurance
A safety net helps everyone reach their potential. We support Universal Basic Income to provide economic security, along with affordable child care and daycare programs that allow parents to work without sacrificing their children's wellbeing. Supporting families strengthens our entire society.
Our Mission
Statement of Intent
The Moderate Party exists to give political power back to everyday Americans. For too long, extremists on both sides have been in control of our government, and everyone is worse off. By organizing regular people all over the country, we can make America normal again!
Our Goals
		1 million members by 2028
		Elect Moderates in city, county, state, and federal elections in 2028
		Save America from the extremists
Action Plan
How we're building a movement of normal people
01
Start Local
Establish local chapters and build community trust from the ground up
02
Organize Normal People
Build coalitions of voters who feel left out by the extremes
03
Run Credible Candidates
No embarrassing kooks, crazies, or fringe weirdos. Just normal people
A Big Tent for Everyone
We don't discriminate and we don't have purity tests. We know we won't always agree, but that's OK. If you're basically normal, you're one of us.
A Reminder
America is a democracy, and there are more normal people than there are extremists. If we organize and build political power together, we can change the country!
